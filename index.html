        <h3>About</h3>

<p>This is a recreation of the original Command and Conquer, Real Time Strategy game entirely in HTML5 and Javascript. </p>

<p>This project is only intended as a technical proof of concept to demonstrate the basic working elements of an RTS game in HTML5. No commercial use is intended. All images and sounds used are from C&amp;C - Tiberian Dawn and are property of the original game creators.</p>

<p>This game works best on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The images can take a little while to load so please be patient.</p>
